## Data-Driven Design (D3) Deadlines [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/abhshkdz/ai-deadlines.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.com/abhshkdz/ai-deadlines)

Countdown timers to keep track of a bunch of conference, journal, and workshop deadlines of relevance to the [IDEAL Lab](http://ideal.umd.edu), primarily at the union of Design and Machine Learning, also including internal lab deadlines where applicable.

See: http://ideal.umd.edu/d3-deadlines/

## Contributing

To add or update a deadline:
- Fork the repository
- Update `_data/conferences.yml`
- Make sure it has the `title`, `year`, `id`, `link`, `deadline`, `timezone`, `date`, `place`, `sub` attributes
    + See available timezone strings [here](https://momentjs.com/timezone/).
- Optionally add a `note` and `abstract_deadline` in case the conference has a separate mandatory abstract deadline
- Optionally add `hindex` (refers to h5-index from [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&vq=eng))
- Send a pull request
